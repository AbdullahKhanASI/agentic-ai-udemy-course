**Companies Not Selected:**

1. **Ama Care**: While it has promising growth in the healthcare sector in Estonia with the recent funding of €500k, its regional focus limits immediate diversification opportunities compared to the broader potential seen in Reserv.

2. **Multiply**: Despite a significant market share in integration solutions, the slower pace of niche market integration versus broader event management opportunities places it behind Reserv in immediate appeal.

3. **Neurons**: The company is well-positioned in AI, with strong funding and industry recognition; however, the AI market's competitive landscape presents higher risks compared to Reserv's well-defined growth path.

4. **Bware Labs**: Blockchain presents high growth opportunities, yet the decentralized and unpredictable nature of technology adoption can present risk factors less present in the event management field.

5. **JourneyTrack**: Although there's a rising demand for customer experience solutions, Reserv's significant funding and cohesive market positioning better align with clearer immediate investment returns.

**Conclusion**: Reserv is recommended as the best investment option due to its strong positioning in an expanding market, bolstered by substantial funding, offering clear pathways to growth and competitive advantages in the lively event management sector.
